The project workflow is split into 3 domains: prod, debug, and qemu
Once a development mode is chose with "make use DEV_MODE=<selected_mode>" each tool script will only refrence that mode.
Each mode has its own respective build output directory to minimize rebuilds.

For example doing this creates a build for each mode:
make use DEV_MODE=prod
make build
make use DEV_MODE=debug
make build
make use DEV_MODE=qemu
make build

The workflow for development is as follows:
1) make use DEV_MODE=<selected_mode> (switch to mode & refrence that respective build)
2) make menuconfig                   (make modifications to the defconfig for that mode)
3) make saveconfig                   (save config to respective mode defconfig file)
4) make build                        (Build with outputs in the output-<mode> directory)
